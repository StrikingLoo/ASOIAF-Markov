       " ' Last year when he took ill, the Citadel had sent Pylos out from Oldtown, mere days before Lord Stannis had closed the isle ',\n",
       " ' to help him in his labors, it was said, but Cressen knew the truth',\n",
       " ' Pylos had come to replace him when he died',\n",
       " ' He did not mind',\n",
       " ' Someone must take his place, and sooner than he would like ',\n",
       " 'He let the younger man settle him behind his books and papers',\n",

       " ' Behind her, shuffling and hopping in that queer sideways walk of his, came her fool',\n",
       " ' On his head was a mock helm fashioned from an old tin bucket, with a rack of deer antlers strapped to the crown and hung with cowbells',\n",
       " ' With his every lurching step, the bells rang, each with a different voice, clang-a-dang bong-dong ring-a-ling clong clong clong',\n",

       " ' If only he had more humor, more life in him; that was what was needed here',\n",
       " ' Grim places needed lightening, not solemnity, and Dragonstone was grim beyond a doubt, a lonely citadel in the wet waste surrounded by storm and salt, with the smoking shadow of the mountain at its back',\n",
       " ' A maester must go where he is sent, so Cressen had come here with his lord some twelve years past, and he had served, and served well',\n",
       " ' Yet he had never loved Dragonstone, nor ever felt truly at home here',\n",
       " ' Of late, when he woke from restless dreams in which the red woman figured disturbingly, he often did not know where he was',\n",
       " 'The fool turned his patched and piebald head to watch Pylos climb the steep iron steps to the rookery',\n",

       " ' Perhaps once he could evoke gales of laughter with a quip, but the sea had taken that power from him, along with half his wits and all his memory',\n",
       " ' He was soft and obese, subject to twitches and trembles, incoherent as often as not',\n",
       " ' The girl was the only one who laughed at him now, the only one who cared if he lived or died',\n",

       " ' A castle must have towers wherever two walls meet at an angle, for defense',\n",
       " ' The Valyrians fashioned these towers in the shape of dragons to make their fortress seem more fearsome, just as they crowned their walls with a thousand gargoyles instead of simple crenellations',\n",
       " '” He took her small pink hand in his own frail spotted one and gave it a gentle squeeze',\n",
       " ' “So you see, there is nothing to fear',\n",

       " ' “What about the thing in the sky? Dalla and Matrice were talking by the well, and Dalla said she heard the red woman tell Mother that it was dragonsbreath',\n",
       " ' If the dragons are breathing, doesn’t that mean they are coming to life?”The red woman, Maester Cressen thought sourly',\n",
       " ' Ill enough that she’s filled the head of the mother with her madness, must she poison the daughter’s dreams as well? He would have a stern word with Dalla, warn her not to spread such tales',\n",
       " ' “The thing in the sky is a comet, sweet child',\n",
       " ' A star with a tail, lost in the heavens',\n",

       " ' The white ravens fly only from the Citadel',\n",
       " '” Cressen’s fingers went to the chain about his neck, each link forged from a different metal, each symbolizing his mastery of another branch of learning; the maester’s collar, mark of his order',\n",
       " ' In the pride of his youth, he had worn it easily, but now it seemed heavy to him, the metal cold against his skin',\n",
       " ' “They are larger than other ravens, and more clever, bred to carry only the most important messages',\n",
       " ' This one came to tell us that the Conclave has met, considered the reports and measurements made by maesters all over the realm, and declared this great summer done at last',\n",
       " ' Ten years, two turns, and sixteen days it lasted, the longest summer in living memory',\n",
       " '”“Will it get cold now?” Shireen was a summer child, and had never known true cold',\n",
       " '“In time,” Cressen replied',\n",
       " ' “If the gods are good, they will grant us a warm autumn and bountiful harvests, so we might prepare for the winter to come',\n",
       " '” The smallfolk said that a long summer meant an even longer winter, but the maester saw no reason to frighten the child with such tales',\n",
       " 'Patchface rang his bells',\n",
       " ' “It is always summer under the sea,” he intoned',\n",
       " ' “The merwives wear nennymoans in their hair and weave gowns of silver seaweed',\n",

       " ' “Ah, here is Pylos with the bird',\n",
       " '”Shireen gave a cry of delight',\n",
       " ' Even Cressen had to admit the bird made an impressive sight, white as snow and larger than any hawk, with the bright black eyes that meant it was no mere albino, but a truebred white raven of the Citadel',\n",
       " ' “Here,” he called',\n",
       " ' The raven spread its wings, leapt into the air, and flapped noisily across the room to land on the table beside him',\n",

       " '” He began to sing',\n",
       " ' “The shadows come to dance, my lord, dance my lord, dance my lord,” he sang, hopping from one foot to the other and back again',\n",

       " ' No one had ever taught Stannis how to laugh, least of all the boy Patchface',\n",
       " ' The storm came up suddenly, howling, and Shipbreaker Bay proved the truth of its name',\n",

       " ' From its parapets his two eldest sons had watched as their father’s ship was smashed against the rocks and swallowed by the waters',\n",
       " ' A hundred oarsmen and sailors went down with Lord Steffon Baratheon and his lady wife, and for days thereafter every tide left a fresh crop of swollen corpses on the strand below Storm’s End',\n",

       " ' Yet his fool’s face left no doubt of who he was',\n",
       " ' It was the fashion in the Free City of Volantis to tattoo the faces of slaves and servants; from neck to scalp the boy’s skin had been patterned in squares of red and green motley',\n",

       " ' Within Storm’s End, the horses had long since been eaten, the dogs and cats were gone, and the garrison was down to roots and rats',\n",
       " ' Then came a night when the moon was new and black clouds hid the stars',\n",
       " ' Cloaked in that darkness, Davos the smuggler had dared the Redwyne cordon and the rocks of Shipbreaker Bay alike',\n",
       " ' His little ship had a black hull, black sails, black oars, and a hold crammed with onions and salt fish',\n",
       " ' Little enough, yet it had kept the garrison alive long enough for Eddard Stark to reach Storm’s End and break the siege',\n",
       " 'Lord Stannis had rewarded Davos with choice lands on Cape Wrath, a small keep, and a knight’s honors ',\n",
       " ' but he had also decreed that he lose a joint of each finger on his left hand, to pay for all his years of smuggling',\n",
       " ' Davos had submitted, on the condition that Stannis wield the knife himself; he would accept no punishment from lesser hands',\n",
       " ' The lord had used a butcher’s cleaver, the better to cut clean and true',\n",
       " ' Afterward, Davos had chosen the name Seaworth for his new-made house, and he took for his banner a black ship on a pale grey field—with an onion on its sails',\n",
       " ' The onetime smuggler was fond of saying that Lord Stannis had done him a boon, by giving him four less fingernails to clean and trim',\n",

       " 'Lord Stannis Baratheon’s refuge was a great round room with walls of bare black stone and four tall narrow windows that looked out to the four points of the compass',\n",
       " ' In the center of the chamber was the great table from which it took its name, a massive slab of carved wood fashioned at the command of Aegon Targaryen in the days before the Conquest',\n",
       " ' The Painted Table was more than fifty feet long, perhaps half that wide at its widest point, but less than four feet across at its narrowest',\n",
       " ' Aegon’s carpenters had shaped it after the land of Westeros, sawing out each bay and peninsula until the table nowhere ran straight',\n",
       " ' On its surface, darkened by near three hundred years of varnish, were painted the Seven Kingdoms as they had been in Aegon’s day; rivers and mountains, castles and cities, lakes and forests',\n",
       " 'There was a single chair in the room, carefully positioned in the precise place that Dragonstone occupied off the coast of Westeros, and raised up to give a good view of the tabletop',\n",
       " ' Seated in the chair was a man in a tight-laced leather jerkin and breeches of roughspun brown wool',\n",

       " 'Stannis Baratheon, Lord of Dragonstone and by the grace of the gods rightful heir to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, was broad of shoulder and sinewy of limb, with a tightness to his face and flesh that spoke of leather cured in the sun until it was as tough as steel',\n",
       " ' Hard was the word men used when they spoke of Stannis, and hard he was',\n",
       " ' Though he was not yet five-and-thirty, only a fringe of thin black hair remained on his head, circling behind his ears like the shadow of a crown',\n",

       " ' Maester Cressen had never seen it, but they said it was a wild thing, thick and fierce',\n",
       " ' As if in answer, Stannis kept his own whiskers cropped tight and short',\n",
       " ' They lay like a blue-black shadow across his square jaw and the bony hollows of his cheeks',\n",
       " ' His eyes were open wounds beneath his heavy brows, a blue as dark as the sea by night',\n",
       " ' His mouth would have given despair to even the drollest of fools; it was a mouth made for frowns and scowls and sharply worded commands, all thin pale lips and clenched muscles, a mouth that had forgotten how to smile and had never known how to laugh',\n",
       " ' Sometimes when the world grew very still and silent of a night, Maester Cressen fancied he could hear Lord Stannis grinding his teeth half a castle away',\n",

       " ' You always do, don’t you?”“I would be of no help to you if I did not,” Cressen said',\n",

       " ' I took it because Robert’s enemies were here and he commanded me to root them out',\n",

       " ' Storm’s End belonged to House Baratheon for three hundred years; by rights it should have passed to me when Robert took the Iron Throne',\n",
       " '”It was an old grievance, deeply felt, and never more so than now',\n",
       " ' Here was the heart of his lord’s weakness; for Dragonstone, old and strong though it was, commanded the allegiance of only a handful of lesser lords, whose stony island holdings were too thinly peopled to yield up the men that Stannis needed',\n",
       " ' Even with the sellswords he had brought across the narrow sea from the Free Cities of Myr and Lys, the host camped outside his walls was far too small to bring down the power of House Lannister',\n",
       " '“Robert did you an injustice,” Maester Cressen replied carefully, “yet he had sound reasons',\n",
       " ' Dragonstone had long been the seat of House Targaryen',\n",
       " ' He needed a man’s strength to rule here, and Renly was but a child',\n",
       " '”“He is a child still,” Stannis declared, his anger ringing loud in the empty hall, “a thieving child who thinks to snatch the crown off my brow',\n",
       " ' What has Renly ever done to earn a throne? He sits in council and jests with Littlefinger, and at tourneys he dons his splendid suit of armor and allows himself to be knocked off his horse by a better man',\n",
       " ' That is the sum of my brother Renly, who thinks he ought to be a king',\n",
       " ' I ask you, why did the gods inflict me with brothers?”“I cannot answer for the gods',\n",
       " '”“You seldom answer at all these days, it seems to me',\n",

       " '” The youngest of Lord Steffon’s three sons had grown into a man bold but heedless, who acted from impulse rather than calculation',\n",
       " ' In that, as in so much else, Renly was like his brother Robert, and utterly unlike Stannis',\n",
       " '“Your Grace,” Stannis repeated bitterly',\n",
       " ' “You mock me with a king’s style, yet what am I king of? Dragonstone and a few rocks in the narrow sea, there is my kingdom',\n",
       " '” He descended the steps of his chair to stand before the table, his shadow falling across the mouth of the Blackwater Rush and the painted forest where King’s Landing now stood',\n",

       " ' Velaryon will threaten to take his levies home unless we strike at once',\n",
       " ' What am I to tell them? What must I do now?”“Your true enemies are the Lannisters, my lord,” Maester Cressen answered',\n",
       " ' “If you and your brother were to make common cause against them—”“I will not treat with Renly,” Stannis answered in a tone that brooked no argument',\n",
       " ' “Not while he calls himself a king',\n",
       " '”“Not Renly, then,” the maester yielded',\n",
       " ' His lord was stubborn and proud; when he had set his mind, there was no changing it',\n",

       " ' Oh, Robert loved him, to be sure',\n",
       " ' Loved him as a brother, how often did I hear that? I was his brother, not Ned Stark, but you would never have known it by the way he treated me',\n",
       " ' I held Storm’s End for him, watching good men starve while Mace Tyrell and Paxter Redwyne feasted within sight of my walls',\n",
       " ' Did Robert thank me? No',\n",
       " ' He thanked Stark, for lifting the siege when we were down to rats and radishes',\n",
       " ' I built a fleet at Robert’s command, took Dragonstone in his name',\n",
       " ' Did he take my hand and say, Well done, brother, whatever should I do without you? No, he blamed me for letting Willem Darry steal away Viserys and the babe, as if I could have stopped it',\n",
       " ' I sat on his council for fifteen years, helping Jon Arryn rule his realm while Robert drank and whored, but when Jon died, did my brother name me his Hand? No, he went galloping off to his dear friend Ned Stark, and offered him the honor',\n",
       " ' And small good it did either of them',\n",
       " '”“Be that as it may, my lord,” Maester Cressen said gently',\n",
